# Example of bindings for cppwinrt.

In this repo you can find creating binding from code and from xaml. Shown bindings with one segment in path (X, Person) and with two segments (Person.Age).

My next step is binding `ListView` `ItemsSource` to `IVector<CustomType>` with custom `DataTemplate`.

Any help would be appreciated.
